Different ways to deploy ML model to frontend 

Approach 1 : Using web sockets.
The user video can be taken from frontend and given to the backend were the sufficient operations can be made and returned a response to the frontend. The response would be a simple text based response.

Approach 2: Using IFRAMES.
In the react app the flutter website can be integrated using iframes. 

Approach 3: Implementing model in frontend react.js
Re-creating the entire model for using in frontend reactjs. This will take more time


Node backend tasks:
Create auth.
create apis for types of exercises.

Flask backend:
Create 3 routes with 3 different models.

Flask Tasks
Connecting mogodb with flask
Creating flask routes
Create api for Exercises table



// Steps for implementing the backend 

create user auth  -- completed registration, login, profile routes
check how to implement the ML model in the JavaScript Backend and the model should run in the server side itself.
check socket implementation react and node.
	implement sockets in react and backend.

Alternative if sockets does not work check how to implement in frontend itself.

// Steps for implementing the frontend
create login signup page in frontend
create profile page in frontend like a dashboard
create a page which takes the users camera and shows the exercises done by him.
